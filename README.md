# sms.party

- A simplistic, free, and dev-centric SMS API made with love by cSMS.
- Containerized, scalable, and dead simple.
- The people's SMS API - **free forever**.

Build with *tools/docker-build.sh*, then run with:

*docker run -d --name sms-p -h sms-p -e PORT=<port> -p <port>:<port> sms-p*

**OR**

Run and build all at once with our lifecycle scripts *tools/sms-up.sh* and *tools/sms-down.sh*
